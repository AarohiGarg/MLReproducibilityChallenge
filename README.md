# **Darts: User-Friendly Modern Machine Learning for Time Series**

**Claim 1:** Darts offers a variety of models, from classics such as ARIMA to state‐of‐the‐art deep neural networks.

**Claim 2:** The library offers modern machine learning functionalities, such as supporting multidimensional series, fitting models on multiple series, training on large datasets, incorporating external data, ensembling models, and providing a rich support for probabilistic forecasting.

**Claim 3:** The API is user‐friendly and easy to use. For instance, all models can be used using fit()/predict(), similar to scikit‐learn.

**Claim 4:** Darts contains many additional features, such as transformers and pipelines for data preprocessing, backtesting (all models offer a backtest() method), hyperparameter search, extensive metrics, a dynamic time warping module, and ensemble models (with the possibility to use a regression model to learn the ensemble itself).

**Claim 5:** Darts also contains filtering models such as Kalman filters and Gaussian Processes, which offer probabilistic modelling of time series.

**Claim 6:** The darts.datasets module contains a variety of publicly available time series which can be conveniently loaded as TimeSeries.
